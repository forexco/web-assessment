# Web assessment

## Your task

Your task is to create a simple website displaying blog articles.

The articles are available [here](http://hammer.forexco.com.au/wp-json/wp/v2/posts?_embed).

The website should have two pages, as described below:

### Latest Articles Page

- it should display the full content of the 4 latest articles
- clicking on an article title should lead to the **Article Page**
- display the titles of all older articles, leading to the **Article Page**

### Article Page

- it should display the full content of an article
- it should be shareable by URL (e.g. https://example.com/articles/my-favourite-article)
- it should display a link leading to the **Latest Articles Page**

## Rules

- we prefer React or Vue, but you can use your tool of choice
- feel free to use any UI library, or create everything by hand - it's your choice
- a nice look is always welcome - but focus on functionality
- please track your spent hours

## Handover

- use a git repository to track your work
- write a README.md with instructions on how to set up and start your solution
- when you are done, send us the link of the repository

## For bonus points (these are optional)

- commit your work frequently
- work on a separate branch and when you are ready, open a Pull Request to the main branch
- write a couple of tests
- use TypeScript
- use server-side-rendering
- use state management or hooks
- host your solution on a cloud service
- surprise us :)
